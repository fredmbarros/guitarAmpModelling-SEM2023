Can guitar amplifiers shape more than tone?

This paper is based on an online ethnography (Fenton and Parry 2022) examining how musicians group around differing views of digital guitar amplifier modeling. For most of the electric guitar’s history, amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes, whose tone-shaping characteristics are integral to the instrument's sound. Over the years, attempts to replace tubes with other technology were largely met with skepticism, but in the last decade discourse around digital emulation becoming virtually indistinguishable from real tubes has begun to surface (Vanhatalo et al. 2022). Two events interest me here: the disclosure of YouTuber Josh Scott's covert use of a modeller during gear demonstrations, and the advent of Neural Amp Modeller (NAM), a piece of free and open-source software that some users claim rivals expensive proprietary solutions. Similarly to Callon's (2006) work on technological controversies, I followed the discussions that ensued on The Gear Page, YouTube comment sections, and the NAM official Facebook group, watching how the participants slowly gathered around clusters of sometimes seemingly incongruent arguments, jumping from physics and psychoacoustics to financial conditions, age, or the effect of an instrument's appearance on their playing. These aggregates of ideas usually combine different orders of justification (Boltanski and Thévenot 1999), and retracing how they take shape helps us see consensus and objectivity being collectively built in the very process of discussion (Latour 2005, 27, 31). This offers a glimpse into the intersections and fissures of contemporary musical life concerning equipment choices, social extraction, age groups, and musical genre preferences.
