### Abstract

This proposal looks at digital modelling of guitar amplifiers to discuss how musicians engage with technology and its implications. An amplifier's tone-shaping characteristics play an integral role in producing the expected sound of an electric guitar and, for the majority of the instrument's history, amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes. Attempts to ditch tubes at least since the 1970s have been for the most part met with skepticism, but in the last ten years discourse around digital emulation being virtually indistinguishable from real tubes started to surface (Vanhatalo et al. 2022). In this paper, I resort to online ethnography (Fenton and Parry 2022) to follow the disclosure by YouTuber Josh Scott of demoing gear covertly using a modeller and the advent of NAM, a piece of free and open source software that, according to some users, offers results on par with expensive proprietary solutions. In these two controversies (Callon 2006), people resorted to arguments of the most diverse nature (Latour 1993), ranging from physics to ageing, from personal finances to the impact of how one feels and looks on one's own playing. We see, thus, how objectivity is built collectively in the process of engaging in discussion, the differential weight attributed to each order of justification (Boltanski and Thévenot 1999) functioning as a nexus around which people gather. By looking at the groups formed around some arguments, we peek into the cleavages and intersections of contemporary musical life concerning equipment choice, social extraction, age groups and genre preferences.
