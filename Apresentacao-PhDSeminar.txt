Apresentação PhD Seminar

There is an ongoing conversation in the guitar world: modellers vs tube amps
- Modellers are…
- in the early 2000s no one took modelling seriously
- Pod, AmpFarm, GuitarRig etc. (procurar quais foram os primeiros amp modellers e ver quem usou - tem algo que vi outro dia de que alguém usava e ainda usa, mas vai achar…
- Tube amps are the standard
    - but not necessarily were: Roland Jazz Chorus (was SS) - from 70s/80s fusion guys to Metallica (procurar onde Metallica usou) to Freddie King to The Cure
    - tubes are old tech
        - add harmonic distortion
            - hard to replicate with transistors
            - digital tries to, with better success
    - from the early 2000s, what you will see is mostly “classic” rock tones (the guitar is a rock instrument, so that’s where I’ll focus)
            - preference for tubes, vintage sounds, Fender guitars and basses become hip again
                - I mention basses here because, interestingly, in the studio they never came out of fashion, but at this point people started showing up with them again (and 90s punk played an important under-appreciated role here, because this has always been part of the punk aesthetic) on stages and promo material

            - there’s a shift from metal to more “earthy” genres and the instruments go together; it’s important to notice and it’s hard to state this without going into numbers, which I can’t do now, but let’s just agree that’s when Mumford and Sons, Edward Sharpe became a thing, while in the 90s what did we have? The Black Crowes and some Lenny Kravitz and Pearl Jam (mas esses são early 90s)—Counting Crows and Wallflowers if you really want to sweat it, but look at how the guitar sound is still so Hi-Fi (One Headlight (1996), though the clothes are already spot on!) compared to Steady as She Goes (2006).
            - For a while electric guitars even took the backseat and acoustics, ukes and banjos were at the forefront (tocar a intro de Elephant gun):
                - foto Beirut, Mumford
                - até um site como Reverb.com aparecer pode ser um indício, embora tenha muito mais coisa em jogo aí (internet, tech, startup culture)
                - Final proof: in 2012 American STD starts coming with Custom Shop 60s pups

- I think I’ve made my case
    - All this creates a situation in which vintage pieces of gear are “aspirational”, something that you 'graduate' to" (https://www.laney.co.uk/blog/solid-state-vs-tube-amps-why-be-forced-to-choose/#:~:text=Solid%2Dstate%20amps%20don%27t,way%20as%20a%20tube%20amp, Oct 4 2023)
    - And forum culture (referencia) creates a situation of production of consensus:
        - exemplo do TB sobre o Ellefson (tenho um screenshot disso)
- So we already had tubes;
    - SS came along and was modern for a while
    - Then it became dated and everyone was into vintage
    - In fact vintage never went totally away, but it was a bit of a trick of the trade (pics of artists using guitars they wouldn’t use in the studio) and then it became mainstream 
    - And a huge market was born
    - And forum culture exposes very clearly how people from the most varied backgrounds and levels of experience are there speaking in a somewhat level playing field and nobody really knows who is who and who knows what they’re talking about

Take this interaction:
People who know nothing about transistors:

The thing that bugs me about all the posts that say what you can't do with transistors is that my guess is that those who are saying that *probably* don't really know anything about how transistors work. I suppose they might... but anyone who knows how transistors work likely would NEVER say such things.

True... if you take a tube amp and replace each stage with a similar transistor-based stage then what you get will NEVER sound like what a tube amp sounds like. And that is EXACTLY what happened with the very first solid-state amps... and why they sounded bad. 

But... transistors are very versatile building blocks and we can put millions of them on a chip and create some very complicated things. And engineers understand precisely how to do these kind of things. And that is what Quilter has done. They use millions of transistors to create circuits that come pretty close to having the same overall input-output function of a tube amp... Is it perfectly the same? Probably not. Is it pretty close? Probably. Will some players be OK with it and others not? Yes. It will depend on the player as well as the job - and its various constraints - that the player is trying to accomplish.

I've never played a Quilter amp... nor have a played any other recent solid-state amps. I play either tube amps (that I've designed and built myself) or I use a modeling amp (which also use millions or billions of transistors to mimic tubes in a very different way... but the main idea is the same - replace a circuit with a number of tubes that you can count on both hands with millions or billions of transistors). But how do I know that solid-state amplifiers have this potential? Because I've been teaching circuits and electronics at the university level for over 20 years. It is very easy to underestimate what *can* be done with transistors - especially if your view is colored by the many horrible SS amps that have been made over the decades. But just because someone built the pinto does not mean that someone else can't build a Ferrari out of pretty much the same technology.

So... the Quilters probably sound pretty good (because the guy who designed them took a very different approach from what led to the original SS amps) and he has a pretty good track record as an excellent analog circuit designer)... but if you don't like them that is fine - just don't say that fundamentally you can NEVER design a SS amp that sounds good.

Ian T said:
This is why 40+ years later, tube amps continue to prevail in most professional rigs. Tubes and transistors sound different, period. Digital modeling has made better progress than analog solid state, however, but that's another topic.

Fowler:
You are partly right here. Tube amps do still prevail but that is not based solely on the sound of the current generation of SS amps. There are many reasons that tube amps are still preferred by many - myself included (I like them because they sound good, they are simple, and I can design, build, and modify them to my heart's content). A big part of it is that early SS amps were so horrible... and that makes lots of people (yourself included) constantly imply that *no* SS amp can ever sound good... period. It is a culture thing based on decades of bad SS amps. But you have to admit that today's SS amps sound nothing like the old ones... they keep getting better. And we are at the point where some players (and not only bedroom players) look at all the factors and decide that a SS amp meets their needs.


- this level playing field creates interesting effects
    - the whole mythbusting but also gear shootout videos became a thing
    - People agonizing over the small mid scoop of this or that amplifier and then go play in a bar - if at all playing somewhere

- FOR THIS PRESENTATION, I’D LIKE TO END HERE AND SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE OPEN TO DIGITAL OVER SS BECAUSE DIGITAL WAS A RUPTURE. IT HAD NO PRECEDENT. BUT ALSO BECAUSE MANY OTHER STUFF IN OUR CULTURE PUTS SO MUCH TRUST EVEN IN DIGITAL
- As I said earlier about the Roland jazz chorus, it was modern and hip until it wasn’t anymore, just like the DX7, the Linn drum machine or chorus pedals… 
- …all of which have made or are making a comeback

Part of a larger article I’m working on

Amplifiers are an ongoing conversation,
tube vs ss vs digital
but despite the potential nerdiness of the topic, I believe they are also a conversation that shows some other things, like
how changes in equipment choice are part of larger trends
this is obvious, of course, but it’s interesting to see these are happening, the specifics
that’s what I’ll discuss here

Tube amps are the standard
old tech
were the first (radio, beginning of 20th century)
The earliest amplifiers were basically just cranking up the electric signal from a guitar so it could be heard through a speaker. Guitarists quickly discovered that turning up the volume not only made it louder but also gave a cool overdrive effect.
but new tech was invented:
SS: more efficient, light, reliable
sounded different
and at first just substituted transistors for tubes
and sounded bad
but then came the Roland Jazz Chorus:
from 70s/80s fusion and jazz guys to Metallica (procurar onde Metallica usou) to Freddie King to The Cure
    - as I said, tubes are old tech
		- hard to replicate with transistors
            (- digital tries to, with better success)
