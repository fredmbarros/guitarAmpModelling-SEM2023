# Current state of the guitar amp tone debate: tube amps, pedals, solid state and digital modelling

Useful to understand the terms and some underlying ideas to people's arguments

	- though technically digital modelling amps are solid state, here we'll divide the field in three categories: tube amps, solid state amps and digital modelling amps
	- vacuum tubes: old technology, basically HiFi equipment and guitar amps
		- they introduce "harmonic distortion" that "we find pleasing"
			- explanation of why wattage isn't equal to loudness
	- solid state amps aren't considered capable of offering true tube tone - people say they are sterile-sounding
	- the divide analog vs digital doesn't hold: SS is analog and people say a SS amp isn't on par with a tube one
		- there's more people who go back and forth between tubes and modellers than those who stick with analog, despite being tube or SS (though technically a modelling amp is SS)
			- Quilter: an electron doesn't know if it's a tube or a transistor; you have to voice it right
			- Josh Scott: germanium vs silicon (both are transistors, but the similarity of the argument is interesting), it doesn't really matter; what matters is how you voice the pedal
		
### Complexifying:
	- people are a little less picky with regard to pedals - pedals are also SS and are used "to push clean, 'pedal platform' (tube) amps into overdrive" - but sometimes they are themselves introducing distortion
	- some people will still say "I'd rather use a boost", but at the same time it's common to see people praising overdrive pedals for "behaving like a tube amp"
	- division among guitarrists: jazzers tend to be much more open to SS (the Roland Jazz Chorus is a staple), but even rock/pop/soul/blues/country guitarrists who play "mostly clean" tend not to like them
	
	
## Three camps:
	- "Nothing does what a tube does and nothing ever will"
		- Countered by "Ok Boomer" - elitism, conservatism, superstition
	- "Amp-modelling technology has matured and is now (virtually) indistinguishable
		- Countered by "they've never even experienced a tube doing its thing properly due to various circumstances involving generation, financial means, and lack of opportunity (no space to crank an amp, no vintage "true" equipment within reach)
	
	- Middle ground, various arguments and different positions:
		- "It sounds just like tubes, but feels different under the fingers"
			- Countered by "I've never even experienced the real thing... so what it doesn't feel the same?" - I've never seen anyone say it feels different and it's better this way **and this is something interesting**
		- "It doesn't sound just like tubes, but it doesn't matter in practice"
			- Countered by "but what about how the player feels about it?", "The player plays better if they feel it the way they themselves like it"
			- Also countered by the "Death by a thousand cuts" argument
