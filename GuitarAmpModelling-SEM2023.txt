The current state of the guitar amp tone debate: tube amps, pedals, solid state and digital modeling/profiling

Introduction

Anyone who plays electric guitar in our time has very likely stumbled upon more than one YouTube video showcasing some piece of equipment. Looking it up ourselves or having it shown to us either by a friend or by "the algorithm", talking about gear on the internet is all but inevitable for musicians these days. In fact, it's safe to say that it has become a fundamental part of forming one's opinions. , like when a salesperson showed me an unknown (to me) guitar in a store and replied "yeah, go look it up one the internet before making a decision" after I said I was just looking and would want to think a little more before buying anything. In a sense, internet forums such as The Gear Page, music-related Facebook groups, Instagram posts or YouTube videos and their comments section are instances where groups form[^groupFormation] around reverence or disdain for certain pieces of equipment.


In this article, I will focus on online discussions about digital modelling and profiling of guitar amplifiers, presenting three fairly recent events and exploring the controversies that arose from them: first the disclosure by a famous YouTuber in the guitar space of having covertly used a digital amplifier during gear demonstrations; then the advent of a piece of free and open-source software that some users claim rivals expensive proprietary solutions; finally, I would like to address an ongoing discussion about gain-staging when using guitar amplifier software.

esoteric and nerdy as these themes may seem, what really matters here are the arguments that people mobilize to support their claims. These arguments render visible broader implications and assumptions that in turn offer us a glimpse into what music-making has become in the mid-2020s. In other words, my underlying assumption is that "gear talk on the internet" can reveal much more than futile consumerism. People engage in these conversations to the point of fighting with each other and the number of video reviews, thought pieces and forums posts is staggering by all measures[numbersOfGearTalk].

Similarly to Callon's (2006) work on technological controversies, I followed online discussions on the internet forums The Gear Page and TalkBass, on YouTube comment sections, and in the following Facebook groups: "Neural Amp Modeller (NAM)", "Neural Amp Modeller (NAM) Users (Unofficial)", "Neural DSP users group", "Bass Players", "Tube Guitar Amplifiers", and "Line 6 Helix Family User Group OFFICIAL and ORIGINAL". I watched how the participants in those groups slowly gathered around clusters of sometimes seemingly incongruent arguments, jumping from physics and psychoacoustics to financial conditions, age, or the effect of an instrument's appearance on their playing. These idea aggregates usually combine different orders of justification (Boltanski and Thévenot 1999) and retracing how they take shape helps us see consensus and objectivity being collectively built in the very process of discussion (Latour 2005, 27, 31).

[BREVE EXPLICAÇÃO DE COMO CALLON/LATOUR TRABALHAM E DO QUE SÃO ORDENS DE JUSTIFICAÇÃO PARA BOLTANSKI/THÉV]

## The JHS-Kemper affair
JHS Pedals is a company especialized in making guitar pedals. Its founder, Josh Scott, started fixing and modifying (modding) pedals for himself and for friends around 2007. Word spread out and he started selling those under the name JHS Mods, eventually getting into making his own pedals. At that time, Scott was making a living off flipping gear, that is, buying and selling used equipment, and slowly built a substantial pedal collection that is currently believed to be the largest in the world.[^JhsPedalCollectionLargest]

Scott sometimes defines himself as a pedal historian[^JhsPedalHistorian] and educator[^videoSobreOJohnCordy] and many videos in JHS's channel deal with the history of equipment, people and companies important in guitar history or explain and demonstrate guitar effects, though rarely getting into actual product demos. The channel often produces videos of a mythbusting character too, like the "Can You Hear It?" series, in which blind tests comparing famous pedals to inexpensive alternatives are performed. These tests involve someone from the crew, but the audience can also test itself--though it does not get to interact, as the whole procedure involves only the tester knowing which is which. 

Although not among the largest in numbers,[^JHSPedalsChannelSize] the channel is particularly influential in the guitar space, which can be attested by an interesting event the related to one of the mythbusters-style videos: on March 13, 2023, an episode of the JHS Show compared the inexpensive DigiTech Bad Monkey overdrive pedal to high profile pedals like the Klon Centaur, the Tube Screamer and even JHS's own Morning Glory, suggesting that the Bad Monkey could produce nearly identical tones to those. This sparked massive interest in the pedal, whose used prices skyrocketed in the subsequent weeks, jumping from its typical resale value of $50–$60 to some listings reaching US$1,000. A few people suggested that Scott was doing a "pump and dump scheme" with Bad Monkeys and, whatever one's opinion on the case is, just the effect of such a video on the gear market is enough to show Scott's influence.

Scott's huge pedal collection is featured prominently in virtually all of his company's videos, with plenty of demonstrations and comparisons between the pieces of equipment discussed and notoriously sparse plugs of his own products. He also possesses a substantial collection of amplifiers, but except for a few specific videos, those are less prominent. However, since electric guitars need to have their signal amplified, the usual procedure of a guitar going into the pedals that then go into an amplifier is adopted most of the time. More specifically, in JHS's videos from September 2021 to December 2022, we see the company's own "Loud is More Good", a Fender-style[^refDescricaoLoudIsMoreGood] tube amplifier designed by American maker Milkman Sound for JHS, as the amp of choice.

[SCREENSHOT]

In the screenshot above we see cables getting in and out of the equipment displayed, but we cannot know for sure the whole signal path, as the framing naturally leaves a lot out of the picture. For example, cables usually utilize similar plugs on both ends (though sometimes one can be straight and the other L-shaped), so we could wonder whether the cable leaving the white pedal on the left (guitar pedals are connected right to left, so that would be the last pedal in the signal chain) is really going into the amp at the forefront, given that the plugs do not match. Even then, this could be a custom-made cable sporting different plugs for whatever reason. Anyway, all the sounds we hear appear to be passing through the Loud Is More Good amplifier, which, as with any other guitar amplifier, adds its own color to the sound. Scott demoed his own and various other pedals through this setup, showed the differences between Phasers, Flangers and Choruses, made tests showing how a vintage 60s Shin-Ei Uni-Vibe sounds compared to modern versions of that circuit, and put a Klon Centaur (a pedal that as of November 2024 can be found listed for around US$8000.00 on the used market) side-by-side with supposedly lesser overdrives for the audience's appreciation. Then, on December 20, 2022, JHS released an episode of the JHS Show with the following thumbnail:

[THUMBNAIL DO EPISODIO I'VE BEEN LYING TO YOU]

The whole video is a stunt, as if Josh had gone mad, locked himself in the video production room with two employees, and revealed to the world that they had been using a Kemper Profiler for the show, while the Loud is More Good amp was merely a prop.

[figura loudIsMoreGood-zoado]

At 6:20, Scott shows the amp and states "We've been just... not really turning it on... We turn it on, but it's on standby. If you've paid any attention, like, you (sic) see all the knobs are down and stuff 'cause we got lazy". Before that, around 5:06, the video shows in red letters on a black background: "We did a blind test for a whole year and no one noticed".

The Kemper Profiler is a device that can capture (profile) an amplifier's sound, like a digital snapshot of the amplifier in the state it was when captured. This allows the Kemper to substitute the amplifier, either requiring a speaker or another outlet to be heard and the video itself is a huge ad for the profiles that JHS was releasing at that moment in a joined effort with profile maker Tone Junkie:

[figura kemperProfilesAd]

This touched on the age-old discussion around electric guitar tone and tube amplifiers.[REFERENCIA] Based on radio equipment from the first half of the 20th century, guitar amplifiers employing vaccuum tubes are the oldest type of such device, at least among those still in use. Their most significant characteristic is that, as one increases the gain, they clip the signal in a non-linear fashion, adding what became known as *harmonic distortion*. This behaviour is usually considered what makes the sound of those amplifiers more pleasing.[REFERENCIA]

### Digression: tubes, transistors and code

Despite their sought-after tone, tube amps have their shortcomings. In the 1960s, most venues' Public Address (PA) systems--if they had one at all--were dedicated to the voice, and musicians had to make themselves heard through amplifiers on stage.[^pegarReferenciaNasAbasDoTelefone] Under these conditions, obtaining a clean sound was not always possible and distortion, "harmonic" or otherwise, is not necessarily always desirable. To ensure more headroom (the range of volume before distorting), or even to get louder when distorted, amplifiers became bigger--and as a consequence heavier and harder to lug around. Nowadays PA systems amplify the entire band and guitarists can use lower-wattage tube amplifiers with microphones placed in front to capture their sound, but many players say that, to get "their tone", bigger amps that "move air" are necessary.[^referenciaMoveAir] Even then, tubes are fragile and need to be replaced periodically, thus making those amps constantly in need of care and maintenance. Finally, tubes can behave erratically depending on external conditions such as temperature or electric current, making them inconsistent.

To this day, these shortcomings are still voiced by guitarists. To some, these are part of the deal, while for others these are deal breakers:

EXEMPLOS DE GENTE RECLAMANDO DESSES PROBLEMAS COM VALVULADOS - **INCLUIR OS QUE DAÍ PARTEM PARA SS OU DIGITAL**

Following previous attempts by various makers of using transistor-based circuits instead of tubes--some of which with certain degree of success--, in 1975 Roland introduced the Jazz Chorus 120. Surely the first and maybe the only solid-state amplifier to truly achieve a status of its own, the JC120 was no longer seen as a lesser version of the tube amps that dominated the music industry.[^artigoHistoriaAmpsGuitarWorld] In hindsight, the Jazz Chorus obtained a place for itself, which means that it did not take the place of tube amps. Each had its own sound, its weaknesses and strengths and its fans and detractors. For instance, in the discussion website Reddit, on the r/GuitarAmps subreddit, a user asked "how come solid state amps never took off like tube amps did?", to which another user replied:

> Yeah I think the whole thing OP is missing is... Solid State amps did take off in the 80's and 90's. I was just a kid, but no one I knew had a tube amp. The issue was most of them sounded like shit compared to tube (with basically the amps you've mentioned being the exception).
> I'm not a solid state hater either... my first amp was an ss Fender combo and it sounded amazing at normal bedroom or jamming volumes. Sounded like shit cranked but it was plenty loud as fuck anyway at 2-3... second loudest amp I've ever owned, the other being a ss Sunn Beta (also a badass solid state). I forgot the model name of the Fender unfortunately but it was a truly great amp with such nice distortion and reverb. Jonny Greenwood uses a ss Fender, or did for years at least.
> Anyway I just love and prefer how tube amps respond, sound, feel... obviously it's a difficult thing to replicate and I think the best sounding solid states are the ones that are they're own beast and not necessarily trying to replicate the tube sound.[^notASolidStateHater]

This other response generated some interesting interactions:

> I think originally, amp makers were trying to make the guitar sound accurate. Guitarists didn’t want accurate, they wanted awesome. Cranked tubes add high end because it’s easier to push than lower frequencies. They compress because of power sag and response time. They are large and can vibrate so feedback tends to be resonant. It’s almost like a part of the instrument now.[^interestingInteractions]

Another forum dweller in response:

> This coupled with one thing most people tend to forget, early quality control on ss amps wasn't great and they weren't quite ready to be pushed out on to the market yet. Most failed a huge, flaming and epic death. They were inconsistent junk, no matter where they were in the price structure of the line and gave ss the junk status or cheap status it still has today in guitar amps. They just weren't reliable at all when they came out and they were pushed out too quickly and killed their own long term potential in the market.[^iI2]

Which by its turn got the following reply by forum dweller no. 3:

> Yep. And they demonstrably don’t sound as good. Even as the tech developed. Like, regardless of the reasons, a Valvestate just doesn’t sound as good as a JCM800. It just doesn’t.
> Now, solid state will sound as good some day (and high-end modeling stuff might already be there), but historically pretty much every production solid state amp has been inferior to any decent tube amp.
> Edit: come on; you all know what I’m saying. Yes, Roland, jazz chorus is a good app, etc. But if you look up lists attempting to rank the best amps ever made, on pretty much every list, 9 of the 10 amps listed are going to be tube amps. And that’s for a reason.[^iI3]

Forum dweller no. 4:

> this is simply untrue, “sound better” is subjective and solid state amplification wins in almost every objective measure such as cost, reliability, headroom, amount of gain, transparent amplification + eq control, then start including on board fx (although there’s an argument to be made abt analog vs digital fx) and your point is pretty weak
> tube responsiveness is like the only thing that is “better” but even then it is just because guitarists have learned to adjust their dynamics and playing style around tube amps [^iI4]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarAmps/comments/1fhktq2/comment/lndanxc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Forum dweller 3 again:

> I feel like I’m in bizarro land; every gear post with killer gear features a tube amp, and suddenly everyone is like “solid state amps are great!”[^iI5]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarAmps/comments/1fhktq2/comment/lnf3res/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button



FALAR AQUI DAS POSICOES E ENTAO ENTRAR NA ETNOGRAFIA DE NOVO, APRESENTANDO O QUE AS PESSOAS DISSERAM NO CASO DO JHS-KEMPER **SOBRE AMPS, NÃO SOBRE A HONESTIDADE DO JOSH ETC**

	- the (classic) divide analog vs digital doesn't hold here: SS is analog and people say a SS amp isn't on par with a tube one
		- there's more people who go back and forth between tubes and digital than those who stick with analog, despite being tube or SS
	- And what about pedals?
		- people are a little less picky with regard to pedals - pedals are also SS and are used "to push clean, 'pedal platform' (tube) amps into overdrive" - but sometimes they are themselves introducing distortion
		- some people will still say "I'd rather use a boost", but at the same time it's common to see people praising overdrive pedals for "behaving like a tube amp"
		- another interesting point is that I've never seen anyone mention the waste of energy that tube amps represent:
			> "Most of the energy loss in classic amp designs occurs because of the need to keep the power tubes operating in their linear range. To function optimally, tubes need to be at a certain temperature–this is why you need to warm up a tube amp before you play it. Most of the power draw of tube amps goes towards keeping the tubes hot, as opposed to amplifying the guitar signal.
			> Class D amps function at around 90% efficiency, meaning that only about 10% of the energy put into them gets released as heat. Classic guitar amplifiers convert anywhere from 70% to 90% of the energy they draw from the wall into heat." (https://georgedyermusic.com/2016/11/24/how-do-quilter-amps-work/ Oct 4 2023)
				- attributed to Pat Quilter: an electron doesn't know if it's a tube or a transistor; you have to voice it right
				- Josh Scott: germanium vs silicon (talking about different transistors, but the similarity with Quilter's argument is interesting), it doesn't really matter; what matters is how you voice the pedal
				- The Gear Page user: "Digital modelling might be the missing ingredient in closing the gap between tubes and solid state." (https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/quilter-disappointment.2321918/post-33936105 Oct 4 2023)

## NAM and the open source discussion
- modelling and profiling
- null tests
- NAM vs Kemper/QC/Fractal/Helix/ToneX/etc
- against elitism, lowering barrier of entry
	- curiously, the argument of "feel" surfaced as the tone became indistinguishable
		- how quick the amp responds (SS is faster, but some people claim - in other contexts, meaning, when discussing only tube amps - that there is difference according to speaker - why not bring the speaker thing in this case too?)
		- mushiness and compression (Quilters usually have a compressor/limiter built-in to match the feel of tube amps, at the same time the Two-Rock guy says he doesn't like compression and works to have his amps - usually considered state-of-the-art in terms of boutique tube amps - to compress as little as posssible (Dipped in Tone interview))
	- isn't this "nothing but tubes" thing some form of keeping the outsiders/children in their place?
	- creates the feeling of "when I grow up, I'll go tubes" - "As most players tend to graduate to tube amps from solid-state amplifiers, they (tube amps) can be known as more aspirational amplifiers – something that you 'graduate' to" (https://www.laney.co.uk/blog/solid-state-vs-tube-amps-why-be-forced-to-choose/#:~:text=Solid%2Dstate%20amps%20don%27t,way%20as%20a%20tube%20amp, Oct 4 2023).
	- discussions that tap into the Open Source character of NAM to criticize people selling profiles:
		- "for the people, by the people" or, even better, "for us, by us", as a user put it
		- misunderstanding of what OSS actually implies and accusations by others of being "freeloaders"


People who know nothing about transistors:
https://www.tdpri.com/threads/quilter-amps-what-are-your-thoughts.953963/post-9127734
The thing that bugs me about all the posts that say what you can't do with transistors is that my guess is that those who are saying that *probably* don't really know anything about how transistors work. I suppose they might... but anyone who knows how transistors work likely would NEVER say such things.

True... if you take a tube amp and replace each stage with a similar transistor-based stage then what you get will NEVER sound like what a tube amp sounds like. And that is EXACTLY what happened with the very first solid-state amps... and why they sounded bad. 

But... transistors are very versatile building blocks and we can put millions of them on a chip and create some very complicated things. And engineers understand precisely how to do these kind of things. And that is what Quilter has done. They use millions of transistors to create circuits that come pretty close to having the same overall input-output function of a tube amp... Is it perfectly the same? Probably not. Is it pretty close? Probably. Will some players be OK with it and others not? Yes. It will depend on the player as well as the job - and its various constraints - that the player is trying to accomplish.

I've never played a Quilter amp... nor have a played any other recent solid-state amps. I play either tube amps (that I've designed and built myself) or I use a modeling amp (which also use millions or billions of transistors to mimic tubes in a very different way... but the main idea is the same - replace a circuit with a number of tubes that you can count on both hands with millions or billions of transistors). But how do I know that solid-state amplifiers have this potential? Because I've been teaching circuits and electronics at the university level for over 20 years. It is very easy to underestimate what *can* be done with transistors - especially if your view is colored by the many horrible SS amps that have been made over the decades. But just because someone built the pinto does not mean that someone else can't build a Ferrari out of pretty much the same technology.

So... the Quilters probably sound pretty good (because the guy who designed them took a very different approach from what led to the original SS amps) and he has a pretty good track record as an excellent analog circuit designer)... but if you don't like them that is fine - just don't say that fundamentally you can NEVER design a SS amp that sounds good.

A few posts below:
Ian T said:
This is why 40+ years later, tube amps continue to prevail in most professional rigs. Tubes and transistors sound different, period. Digital modeling has made better progress than analog solid state, however, but that's another topic.

Fowler:
You are partly right here. Tube amps do still prevail but that is not based solely on the sound of the current generation of SS amps. There are many reasons that tube amps are still preferred by many - myself included (I like them because they sound good, they are simple, and I can design, build, and modify them to my heart's content). A big part of it is that early SS amps were so horrible... and that makes lots of people (yourself included) constantly imply that *no* SS amp can ever sound good... period. It is a culture thing based on decades of bad SS amps. But you have to admit that today's SS amps sound nothing like the old ones... they keep getting better. And we are at the point where some players (and not only bedroom players) look at all the factors and decide that a SS amp meets their needs.




Technology as an enabler

Democracy and its advances and reverses throughout History form a complex theme that obviously cannot be satisfactorily dealt within the constraints of this article,[^deibert] so let me limit my scope right from the start. As stated above, I am particularly interested here in forces that enable people to acquire knowledge and broadcast what they make with that knowledge. More specifically, I want to investigate some of the possibilities for people to get their artistic aspirations in motion and eventually released in the current post-pandemic world [RIDÍCULO, ARRUMAR UMA DEFINIÇÃO MELHOR - provavelmente vou ter que pegar alguma explicação sobre o post-pandemic world].

Technology has thus been hailed as a democratizing force in itself--at least since the beginning of the internet age,[^internetAndTech] and today more than ever there's practically no technological affair that isn't connected to the internet (in both senses). Covering a broad spectrum that touches on digital rights activism, the free culture movement, Wikipedia, "copyfight", free and open-source software, crowdfunding, self-publishing initiatives, cryptocurrencies, podcasting, "value-for-value" initiatives, grassroots journalism, the so-called Arab Spring and even YouTube, technology is the common enabler to all of these phenomena. Phenomena that, by its turn, can be regarded as democratizing in one sense or another. More directly related to music, streaming and piracy made entire song catalogs immediately available to anyone with an internet-connected device; blogs and, later, social media made it possible for musicians to cut costs on publicity; and tech-deflation[^techDeflation] (the downward pressure on prices as new tech gets old), put formerly inaccessible "studio-grade" gear in the bedrooms of hobbyists. Music software is especially characteristic of the phenomenon: sounds such as those of a symphony orchestra, ambience like that of a reverb chamber or the tone and affordances of an all-analog Neve console are currently accessible to virtually anyone in the form of a software plugin, whereas they were previously attainable only to artists signed to a big recording label with a correspondingly big budget. 

A great deal of music software is based on coveted pieces of gear, sometimes building upon it but more frequently trying to replicate it as faithfully as possible, including its user interface. At the same time, compared to the hardware it "emulates",[^emulation] software is usually cheaper (potentially free if we consider piracy) and more flexible. All this makes working "in-the-box"[^inTheBox] significantly more attainable to those who can't resort to a traditional studio or something similar. It costs a lot more money to book studio time and the price follows the equipment it possesses,[^studioMojo] but there are also expenses and constraints to be accounted for in the very fact of going to a studio compared to doing it all at home. First, there is the travel time and corresponding gas costs. Second, one must block an entire time slot ahead, as opposed to squeezing some music-making at home between chores or when the day is done. Finally, there's the knowing part: the people, where to go, the vocabulary and the codes to interact in a professional studio.

Of course, the home studio has its limitations too. Acoustics can be a big issue in achieving "radio-ready" results, though room treatment is possible and has also gone down in pricing. Space is also a problem both to fit equipment in a bedroom and because one must avoid making too much noise, especially in urban areas. There are also workarounds, such as wearing headphones or keeping volumes down for mixing or resorting to software that tries to tailor the sound output to the room by employing compensation algorithms and this is where working in-the-box really shines. Still, the feasibility of an apartment-dweller successfully recording drums in their bedroom is severely limited. This is where sample libraries come in, offering drum sounds and patterns recorded by professional studio musicians at high end studios that, in the final mix, will arguably sound better than drum sounds captured in a mid-tier studio at a fraction of the cost and time it would take.

Guitar software and hardware

Software can either be considered easier or harder to use depending on the user's skill and mindset, but it offers a kind of flexibility that hardware rarely achieves–granted, as long as one is working within the constraints of what the product's maker envisioned.[^turingComplete] Software is not as inherently constrained by physical properties such as space and power demands, so, for example, it is common knowledge that tube amplifiers deliver their most sought-after sounds within a certain volume range. This means that one needs to deal with loud sounds to achieve their desired tone certain volume range to deliver its most sought-after sounds software can be made more tweakable: changing the speaker of a software amp to get a different tone can be done in one or two clicks or, in the worst case scenario, through a download followed by the installation of some form of impulse-response or similar technology.[^impulseResponses] A hardware analog amp, by its turn, requires that one buys the speaker and actually goes through the process of removing the old speaker, inserting the new one, soldering connections etc., in a process that usually requires specialized knowledge and includes potentially life-threatening procedures. 

The reason I have been treating software as a metonymy for technology is that in a sense software is where it all "happens" with regard to the digital amplifiers at the center of our discussion in this paper. Though it may sound like I am simply singing the praises of music software, what I actually intend to do in these initial sections is provide as much information as possible about the possibilities and affordances that these solutions offer so that it becomes clearer what is at stake when we start to see people put so much stress on their shortcomings. As we will see below, sometimes a person celebrates a certain feature only to immediately see that same feature be turned on its head and be considered a problem by an interlocutor.

***The model in which most of the coveted music was created was the rock band in a studio [DESENVOLVER]

But in the end what becomes clear here is how things are interconnected, making the whole picture of tech as enabler more complex: people want to record music and they can do it at home now, but the coveted equipment isn't suitable to home use. A studio would be needed, really, due to volume, acoustics and space needs. But then this would require time and financial resources. Studios are less expensive because tech-deflation also put more previously-high end gear within the reach of small/medium studios, but still one needs to block time to go to the studio. Contemporary life, has made it difficult for musicians to live off their music and most of them have day jobs, which makes blocking time much harder and making music late at night in a bedroom is often the only possibility, so the home studio is the way to go in a world in which musicians aren't signed to a big label to do a record and then have their time resources all employed due to that being their job. All things considered, when compared to "the model", tech-enabled home music-making bears the amateur mark from its birth. Due to the conditions in contemporary capitalism, it's not made by people whose efforts can be all concentrated on making it; it's not created in the same spaces as that one was and was created employing simulations of that equipment. Even if one has the same amplifier and mic'ed it with the same coveted vintage microphones of yore, was it recorded in Studio Two of Abbey Road studios (https://www.abbeyroad.com/studio-two), with its "warm acoustics"?...

Moreover, users can combine software with other pieces of software, can use it in series or in parallel with itself multiple times, can split what it does according to different parameters etc. For example: think about passing a guitar signal through three VOX AC30s with the purpose of achieving whatever three AC30s stacked could do: first of all, you'd have to have three units of this fairly expensive amp. Then each one would have to be mic'ed, hopefully minimizing bleed from one to the other, so you'd need three microphones (assuming you'd use only one mic for each) and a room with space and treatment adequate to handle the volume and the specific sound propagation situation that will be created. One surely couldn't do it in a condo, so think about a studio that offered such a structure to perform this in the analogue realm. This is all trivial with software, offering a degree of flexibility virtually impossible in the physical realm:

	[COLOCAR ALGUMA FALA QUE EXEMPLIFIQUE ISSO]

However, usually hardware gear allows for a kind of intervention on its inner workings that is rare in software due to it requiring, 1, that the source code is available and, 2, that the people interested in working on it have the technical expertise to do so. Granted, not every guitarist has the knowledge and ability to get a soldering iron and start messing with pedals, let alone amps. But somehow--at least until the current kids reach adulthood--this is a lower barrier of entry than tinkering with Digital Signal Processing and the like. This can be verified by the abundance of modding, DIY and BYOC[^moddingDIYBYOC] forums on the internet and by how frequently this route is suggested in discussions in other forums:

Exemplos Modding Suggestion

{1} Conversely, at least to my knowledge, someone suggesting a fellow guitarist should go mess with a plugin's code is fairly unusual. Maybe there is something here related to the fact that doing small fixes on one's own instrument is usually regarded as an ability a professional musician should possess, and then perhaps it passes over to hardware equipment in general. Software (so far) doesn't occupy a similar position and, as I said above, at the very least one needs to have access to the programs' source code to be able to modify it, which is in itself something rare in an industry that is built around the (supposed or real) exclusivity and uniqueness of each maker's intellectual property.[^examplesOfIndustryHype] Intimatelly connected to it, the flexibility that the digital realm possesses puts its users in an intermediary position that helps create ecosystem lock-in. This can be seen in the existence of a huge market for presets, impulse-responses and amp models/profiles. Usually these programs offer the ability to create presets, which are a way to store and later recover settings that the user may have liked or found useful. People sell or share presets they make and the fact that there is such a market for it shows that many users are not even interested in tinkering or learning to tinker with the gain and volume knobs or the EQ section of their software amps and prefer to rely on other users' ears and ability.[^presetSharingAndCommunity]

All this creates a somewhat predictable divide between the analogue and the digital realms. Some would say that, being different in nature, it would make them incommensurable with regard to the knowledge the user can carry from one to the other. At the same time, since music software has the tendency to imitate--sometimes in minute detail--the analogue gear after which it is modelled, it could be expected that regular use could be translated directly. Take as an example the coveted all-analogue Tone King Imperial MKII and the interface of Neural DSP's digital version of the same amplifier:

Nevertheless, comparisons between digital versions and "the real deal" are legion. For instance, here's what turns up in a simple YouTube search (on 2023-11-14) using the query "Neural DSP Tone King Imperial MKII vs real amp":

### Tubes, transistors and code

There is a third kind of amplifier that occupies sort of an intermediary position in this discussion: hardware digital amps. These are hardware amps that employ digital technology in some of its components. What the digital part is doing varies considerably from model to model, some being all analogue with only a digital reverb, while others have a great deal of their tone produced by their onboard computers. Many are in fact entirely *solid-state*, employing both digital and analogue tone-producing means, while others are tube amps with digital technology added (like a load box and cabinet simulator,[^loadBoxCabSim] for example), often including all three technologies spread across different parts of the device.

Despite the fact that I have been dwelling on the split between the analogue and digital realms and how it pertains to our discussion, I'd like to suggest another categorization. This perspective does not render the other obsolete, but rather adds another layer to the discussion: tube amps, solid state amps and digital modelling/profiling amps. For us to be able to keep up with the arguments that we will see some users elaborate below, a basic, working understanding of these three types can be useful.


## Three camps, two paradigms:
- we can talk about two paradigms:
		- the traditional paradigm: tube amps, hard (heavy) to carry around, knobs, plug and play, direct control of defined parameters (which are in principle discrete, but there can be a lot of interaction between them when you dig), more flexibility (easier) in terms of how adjust it on the fly (one feature of tube amps is that they change their tone according to temperature and energy source, for example);
		- the digital paradigm: software emulation (a brief discussion about the word "emulation"), having to scroll through (endless) menus, harder to tweak on the fly, at the same time tone is always the same, so it's predictable/reliable, light to carry around - but many times you don't carry because they are in computers at home that "bedroom guitarists" use (vs pros, who graduate to tube amps - but the A-level pros (who play with big acts) have been using (and publicizing) more and more modellers for their dependability and predictability). The solutions for gigging musicians try to bridge the gap between the immediacy of hardware solutions and the main selling points of the digital ones.

	- "Nothing does what a tube does and nothing ever will"
		- Countered by "Ok Boomer" - accusations of elitism, conservatism, superstition
	- "Amp-modelling technology has matured and is now (virtually) indistinguishable
		- Countered by "they've never even experienced a tube doing its thing properly due to various circumstances involving generation, financial means, and lack of opportunity (no space to crank an amp, no vintage "true" equipment within reach)
	
	- Middle ground, various arguments and different positions:
		- "It sounds just like tubes, but feels different under the fingers"
			- Countered by "I've never even experienced the real thing... so what it doesn't feel the same?" - I've never seen anyone say it feels different and it's better this way **and this is something interesting**
		- "It doesn't sound just like tubes, but it doesn't matter in practice"
			- Countered by "but what about how the player feels about it?", "The player plays better if they feel it the way they themselves like it"
			- Also countered by the "Death by a thousand cuts" argument
			




CONCLUSÃO

[no início da seção technology as enabler, eu escrevi: "Democracy and its advances and reverses throughout History form a complex theme that obviously cannot be dealt with here,[^deibert] so let me limit my scope right from the start. As stated above, I am particularly interested here in forces that enable people to acquire knowledge and broadcast what they make with that knowledge. More specifically, I want to investigate some of the possibilities for people to get their artistic aspirations in motion and eventually released in the current world [RIDÍCULO, ARRUMAR UMA DEFINIÇÃO MELHOR]." - RETOMAR ESSES PONTOS AGORA NA CONCLUSÃO PARA PODER FECHAR DISCUTINDO ISSO: "In principle, an increase in the circulation and the variety of ideas and artistic works would eventually feed back into more general democratizing processes such as demands for rights and representation or struggles against oppression.[^darnton]]
