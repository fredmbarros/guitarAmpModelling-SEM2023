[^groupFormation]: Group formation is a classic theme in the Social Sciences. For two slightly different perspectives on the subject that guide my thought here, see Latour (Reassembling?) and Barth (Streams of Culture).

[amp>guitar]: It is in fact not rare to find forum threads in which people state that, while everybody seems to pay most attention to guitars, amplifiers are more important in producing one's tone.

[^sociologyOfMusicalGenre]: PEGAR REFERENCIAS
[^forumCulture]: Pegar as referências sobre internet forum culture - tem algo na discussão sobre redes sociais na CSA.
[^EnglishSpeakingOverlooksGenre]: This could be an interesting conversation in another article.
[^deibert]: For a general framework for this discussion, dealing with the political reverberations of the democracy and technology problem, see Deibert - Reset.
[^darnton]: For but one far more general consideration of the same type of process, see Robert Darnton's classic works on pre-revolutionary France and the ensuing debate - Darnton, Boemia Literaria e Rev, The Business of Enlightenment and also The Darnton debate. See also the works cited in the next paragraph for something more directly related to our discussion.
[^internetAndTech]: For just a few examples, see Lessig, Free Culture; Doctorow, Information Doesn't Want to be Free; Howard Rheingold, Smart Mobs.
[^techDeflation]: The phenomenon by which technological advancement in the form of economies of scale, increased efficiency, and improvements in production processes leads to previously expensive goods getting cheaper and thus popularized.
[^musicCommunity]: Yes, of course, *what* is the music community? *Who*'s part of if and who's not? Who gets to choose the members of the club? Albeit briefly, we'll touch on this topic below when discussing internet forums and YouTube.
[^emulation]: The term seems to have stuck, but is not entirely accurate, as ns imitating with the intent of surpassing, usually being a somewhat flattering move. What this software does is actually trying to match, to create a form of simulation, a digital replication of the sound and usually also the behavior of the physical gear it's modelled after.
[^inTheBox]: Term used to refer to when someone does all the processing in the computer, simply plugging the instrument straight into the interface.
[^studioMojo]: Interestingly - and this is something we'll have to hold off from discussing today, as it would lead us on a too long detour -, tech-deflation is countered here by the expectation that studios - at least the ones that deserve a musician's money - will have "the real deal" gear to offer, which means standard pro-grade equipment and hopefully some vintage well-known pieces of equipment for "mojo".
[^turingComplete]: referência ou explicação sobre o que é uma Turing-complete machine.
[^impulseResponses]: explicação de IRs e afins.
[^moddingDIYBYOC]: "Modding" is the practice of tweaking and implementing modifications to existing equipment with the purpose of altering its sound or making it do things that it didn't previously do, be it tonally or, more rarely, in terms of functionality. BYOC is an acronym for "build your own clone", which is when someone builds an existing piece of gear (in various degrees of fidelity to the original, from perfect replicas to modded versions or hybrids). Finally, DIY is the well-known acronym for "do it yourself", which is a broader line of thought and sometimes activism that, in its simplest sense, means taking a stance on making things instead of buying them. It involves, among others, movements/phylosophies like Maker, Hacker, Right to Repair, Free Culture, and some branches of the Punk movement.
[^exemploModdingSuggestion]
[^examplesOfIndustryHype]: Dar alguns exemplos de anúncions do tipo "com nosso algoritmo exclusivo" etc.
[^presetSharingAndCommunity]: This is also interesting for the makers of such software, as it leverages the creation of a community to add value to their product not only by making it easier to obtain certain results and variety through the combined knowledge of its users but also by hyping it (the bigger the community, the greater the perception of it being valuable) and by increasing the costs of moving to another platform.
[^loadBoxCabSim]: A load box simulates the impedance of a speaker, making it possible to play an amplifier without a physical speaker connected to it. It is commonly used in conjunction with cabinet simulators, which are either software or hardware solutions to obtain the resulting sound of a cabinet without employing one, thus creating the possibility of running the amp silently, sending its signal straight into the recording interface for in-the-box treatment, for example.









[^webersIdealTypes]: The basic reference, of course, is Max Weber (REF). For starters, there's the marked difference that Weber's ideal types are intellectual constructions built based on the observation of reality, but which don't exist. They are like a condensate constructed intellectually so that one can have a perception of what is most typical of that thing being described. It is, however, in the way these serve as points of reference for investigating reality that the concept can be useful here.
