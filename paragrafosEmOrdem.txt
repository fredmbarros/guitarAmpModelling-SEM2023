> "I like modellers, but my take on it from the beginning was this is a race to the bottom. And eventually somebody is gonna be making US$150 modellers that sound great and fantastic and then the cycle will repeat and high end gear will come back into fashion.[...] I remember in the [...] late 90s, maybe early aughts... the multi-effects processor. Everyone had to have the newest multi-effects processor. People loved them and then all of a sudden it was not cool anymore and if you had one of those you were a 'noob'... a loser... Then you had companies that were taking Tube Screamer circuits and dipping them into paint, making swirls and selling them for US$500 and people were like 'oh, this sounds much better! The best pedal sound ever!' And then someone would reverse engineer, find out it was just a Tube Screamer... [...] it's just a cycle that keeps happening."

Brian Wampler, Chasing Tone - Guitar Podcast about Gear, Effects, Amps and Tone, episode 482 - There's a new sheriff in town - the Fender Tone Master Pro, October 11, 2023.

In this article, I will examine online conversations about digital modelling and profiling of guitar amplifiers. Esoteric and nerdy as these themes may seem, what really matters here are the arguments that people mobilize to support their claims. These arguments render visible broader implications and assumptions that in turn offer us a glimpse into what music-making has become in the mid-2020s. In other words, my underlying assumption is that "gear talk on the internet" can reveal much more than futile consumerism. Internet forums are instances where groups form[^groupFormation] around reverence or disdain for certain pieces of equipment, and people engage in these conversations to the point of fighting with each other.

Similarly to Callon's (2006) work on technological controversies, I followed online discussions on the internet forums The Gear Page, Telecaster Page Discussion Reissue, and TalkBass; on discussion site Reddit; on YouTube comment sections; and in the following Facebook groups: "Neural Amp Modeller (NAM)", "Neural Amp Modeller (NAM) Users (Unofficial)", "Neural DSP users group", "Bass Players", "Tube Guitar Amplifiers", and "Line 6 Helix Family User Group OFFICIAL and ORIGINAL". I watched how the participants in those groups slowly gathered around clusters of sometimes seemingly incongruent arguments, jumping from physics and psychoacoustics to financial conditions, age, or the effect of an instrument's appearance on their playing. These idea aggregates usually combine different "families" of arguments that work more or less like Boltanski and Thévenot's (1999) "orders of worth".

Boltanski and Thévenot (1999) propose that people justify their actions and arguments through different "orders of worth", which are like frameworks rooted in distinct principles that people invoke to determine what is valuable or worthy in a particular situation. For example, in some contexts, people might justify decisions based on *efficiency*, while in others, they might resort to arguments related to *public recognition*, or *moral or civic duty*. Each of those principles refers to a different order (or "world"--see Boltanski and Thévenot 2006, Part 6, Six), a system of worth with its own set of values, rules, and criteria for what is considered appropriate or legitimate.

Boltanski and Thévenot identify several worlds and do an investigation of their guiding principles. Though interesting and insightful, delving into the full argument here would require a lengthy digression that would be better left for another occasion. I will simply note that criticism or debate usually occurs when people invoke contrasting principles or when they ascribe different weights to them while judging a situation.

In the case of online discussions about guitar equipment, the principles of justification that participants invoke are similarly multifaceted and often draw from different "worlds" of worth. For example, users may justify their preferences for certain amplifiers or effects by referencing:

1. *Technical and Practical Considerations*: the performance, efficiency, and effectiveness of a product;
   
2. *Cost and resale value*: the cost-effectiveness, brand value, availability and how much one can recoup back when selling a piece of equipment;
   
3. *Aesthetic and artistic considerations*: values connected to personal expression, tone, creativity and how much that piece of gear inspires one to play;
   
4. *Public recognition and popular opinion*: what is fashionable or widely accepted--this is where forum culture is more directly at play;
   
5. *Personal and emotional attachments*: sentimental or relational value, as when someone inherited, has been given or found a rare piece of gear and becomes attached to it.

These clusters of arguments are not discrete. On the contrary, they intersect, overlap, merge, and, of course, fight against each other--even in the case of the same person speaking about a specific piece of equipment. People usually weave together multiple types of justification, relying on different worlds at the same time to make their point and that is the most interesting aspect of Boltanski and Thévenot's model. For instance, someone might combine arguments related to, on one side, technical characteristics and, on another side, affordability to argue for a pedal's value. Then they may bolster their argument further by also adding how widely used that pedal is. On other situations, instead of stacking up arguments from different worlds, a single argument may itself be a composite, like a vintage instrument inherited from an older family member: its "vintage-ness" comes at the same time from it being old and from it being from an older person whose history is entangled with the instrument itself.

The worlds in this theoretical model represent various ways that people approach and discuss guitar amplification, each providing a different lens through which musicians and enthusiasts can interpret and justify their choices. I will introduce examples and themes throughout the text to illustrate these justifications. Experimentally, I won't focus on identifying specific actors or individuals in these discussions. Instead, my interest lies in observing what they rely on when making their points.

This theoretical model helps attune our ears to the various layers present and their relative weight in each person's speech. By examining the types of arguments people use in these discussions and how they mobilize different worlds of justification, we can gain insight into how value is constructed in the realm of music technology and what these values reveal about the broader socio-cultural dynamics of contemporary music-making. In these online communities, participants are not just arguing over equipment but also negotiating what counts as legitimate knowledge, expertise, and value with regard to guitar gear, much like how different principles of worth shape social and professional justifications in other spheres. On a more general level, retracing how these conversations take shape helps us see consensus and objectivity being collectively built in the very process of discussion (Latour 2005, 27, 31).

Equipment has probably always been part of the conversation among musicians and these days gear talk on the internet has become a fundamental part of forming one's opinions, like when a salesperson showed me an unknown (to me) guitar in a store and, when I said I would rather think a little more before buying anything, replied with slight sarcasm: "yeah, go look it up online before making a decision..."

Another anecdote can be interesting to kick of the discussion. On December 20, 2022, the JHS Pedals YouTube channel released an episode of the JHS Show with the following thumbnail:

[THUMBNAIL DO EPISODIO I'VE BEEN LYING TO YOU]

The whole video is a stunt, as if JHS's owner, Josh Scott, had gone mad, locked himself in the video production room with two employees, and revealed to the world that they had been using a digital clone of a guitar amplifier to make videos demonstrating how guitar pedals sound while making it look like they were using an actual amp.

Around 6:20, Scott shows the amp and states "We've been just... not really turning it on... We turn it on, but it's on standby. If you've paid any attention, like, you (sic) see all the knobs are down and stuff 'cause we got lazy". Before that, around 5:06, the video shows in red letters on a black background: "We did a blind test for a whole year and no one noticed".

[figura loudIsMoreGood-zoado]

JHS Pedals is a company specialized in making guitar pedals. The company's founder, Josh Scott, started fixing and modifying (modding) pedals for himself and for friends around 2007. After a while, he began selling those under the name JHS Mods, eventually making his own pedals. At that time, Scott was living off flipping gear, that is, buying and selling used equipment, and slowly built a substantial pedal collection that is currently believed to be the largest in the world.[^JhsPedalCollectionLargest]

Scott sometimes defines himself as a pedal historian[^JhsPedalHistorian] and educator[^videoSobreOJohnCordy] and many videos in JHS's channel deal with the history of equipment, people and companies important in guitar history or explain and demonstrate guitar sounds and the equipment used to achieve them, though rarely getting into actual product demos. The channel often produces videos of a mythbusting character too, like the "Can You Hear It?" series, in which blind tests comparing famous pedals to inexpensive alternatives are performed. 

Although not among the largest in numbers,[^JHSPedalsChannelSize] the channel is particularly influential in the guitar space. For example, on March 13, 2023, an episode of the JHS Show compared the inexpensive DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive pedal to high profile counterparts like the Klon Centaur, a Tube Screamer and even JHS's own Morning Glory, suggesting that the Bad Monkey could produce identical tones to those. This immediately sparked massive interest in the pedal, whose used prices skyrocketed in the subsequent weeks from its typical resale value in the US$50-60 range to some listings reaching US$1,000, and as a consequence showing Scott's power over the gear market.

Scott's huge pedal collection is featured prominently in virtually all of his company's videos, with plenty of demonstrations and comparisons between pieces of equipment and notoriously sparse plugs of his own products. He also possesses a substantial collection of amplifiers but, except for a few specific videos, those are less prominent. However, since electric guitars need to have their signal amplified, the usual procedure of a guitar going into pedals and then into an amplifier is adopted most of the time. More specifically, in JHS's videos from September 2021 to December 2022, we see the company's own "Loud is More Good"[^refDescricaoLoudIsMoreGood] tube amplifier as the amp of choice.

[SCREENSHOT]

Guitar amplifiers necessarily add their own colour to the guitar's tone, so it is expected that the Loud Is More Good would play a big part in the final sound.[amp>guitar] The Loud Is More Good is actually advertised as a great "pedal platform" amplifier, that is, an amp with a well-known and fairly neutral sound profile (a Fender-style amp, in this case) that interacts well with pedals. Throughout the mentioned time-frame (September 2021 to December 2022), among other things, Scott demoed his own and various other pedals through this setup, split-hairs about phasers and flangers, made tests showing how a vintage 60s Shin-Ei Uni-Vibe sounds compared to modern versions of that circuit, and put a Klon Centaur (a pedal that as of November 2024 can be found listed for around US$8000.00 on the used market) side-by-side with supposedly lesser overdrives for the audience's appreciation. 

In all these demonstrations, Scott needed the amp's sound as a constant so that people could evaluate the pedals being discussed, so by suggesting they were using an amplifier that they were not, the tests fall apart. The assumption--or rather the point Scott is obliquely trying to make--is that the digital emulation is entirely equivalent to the real thing. JHS's "blind test", thus, fed off a never-ending discussion around electric guitar tone and amplifiers.

***

Based on radio equipment from the first half of the 20th century, guitar amplifiers employing vaccuum tubes are the oldest type of such device, at least among those still in use. Their most significant characteristic is that, as one pushes their output up, they start to change the sound, adding what became known as *harmonic distortion* by clipping the signal in a non-linear fashion. This behaviour is usually considered what makes the sound of those amplifiers more pleasing.[REFERENCIA]

Despite their sought-after tone, tube amps have their shortcomings. In the 1960s, most venues' Public Address (PA) systems--if they had one at all--were dedicated to the voice, and musicians had to make themselves heard through amplifiers on stage.[^pegarReferenciaNasAbasDoTelefone] Under these conditions, obtaining a clean sound was not always possible and distortion, "harmonic" or otherwise, is not necessarily desirable. To ensure more headroom (the range of volume before distorting), or even to get louder when distorted, amplifiers became bigger--and as a consequence heavier and harder to lug around. Nowadays PA systems amplify the entire band and guitarists can use lower-wattage tube amplifiers with microphones placed in front to capture their sound and also send it to the PA, but many players say that, to get "their tone", bigger amps that "move air" are necessary.[^referenciaMoveAir] Even then, tubes are fragile, need to be replaced periodically, making those amps in need of constant care and maintenance. Finally, tubes are getting scarce, as less and less devices employ them, and can behave erratically depending on external conditions such as temperature or electric current.

To some, these shortcomings are part of the deal, while others consider them deal breakers. For decades now, people have been arguing if an adequate tube replacement has come along and what trade-offs it brings.[REFERENCIA] 

Invented in 1947, various attempts were made of substituting transistor-based circuits for tubes--some with certain degree of success--, before Roland Corporation introduced the Jazz Chorus 120 in 1975. The first and maybe the only solid-state amplifier to truly achieve a status of its own, the JC120 was not seen as a lesser version of the tube amps that dominated the music industry.[^artigoHistoriaAmpsGuitarWorld]. Obtaining a place for itself meant, however, that it did not replace tube amps: each had its own sound, its weaknesses and strengths, its fans and detractors. At the same time, tubes remain the benchmark and the discussion about transistors being able to do what they do inevitably surfaces at some point:

> True... if you take a tube amp and replace each stage with a similar transistor-based stage then what you get will NEVER sound like what a tube amp sounds like. And that is EXACTLY what happened with the very first solid-state amps... and why they sounded bad. 
> But... transistors are very versatile building blocks and we can put millions of them on a chip and create some very complicated things. And engineers understand precisely how to do these kind of things. And that is what Quilter [^quilter] has done. They use millions of transistors to create circuits that come pretty close to having the same overall input-output function of a tube amp... Is it perfectly the same? Probably not. Is it pretty close? Probably. Will some players be OK with it and others not? Yes. It will depend on the player as well as the job - and its various constraints - that the player is trying to accomplish.
> I've never played a Quilter amp... nor have I played any other recent solid-state amps. I play either tube amps (that I've designed and built myself) or I use a modeling amp (which also use millions or billions of transistors to mimic tubes in a very different way... but the main idea is the same - replace a circuit with a number of tubes that you can count on both hands with millions or billions of transistors). But how do I know that solid-state amplifiers have this potential? Because I've been teaching circuits and electronics at the university level for over 20 years. It is very easy to underestimate what *can* be done with transistors - especially if your view is colored by the many horrible SS amps that have been made over the decades. But just because someone built the [Ford] Pinto does not mean that someone else can't build a Ferrari out of pretty much the same technology.

A few posts below, another user said:
> This is why 40+ years later, tube amps continue to prevail in most professional rigs. Tubes and transistors sound different, period. Digital modeling has made better progress than analog solid state, however, but that's another topic.

Getting a reply from the first user:
> You are partly right here. Tube amps do still prevail but that is not based solely on the sound of the current generation of SS amps. There are many reasons that tube amps are still preferred by many - myself included (I like them because they sound good, they are simple, and I can design, build, and modify them to my heart's content). A big part of it is that early SS amps were so horrible... and that makes lots of people (yourself included) constantly imply that *no* SS amp can ever sound good... period. It is a culture thing based on decades of bad SS amps. But you have to admit that today's SS amps sound nothing like the old ones... they keep getting better. And we are at the point where some players (and not only bedroom players) look at all the factors and decide that a SS amp meets their needs.[^refFowler]

On the Reddit forum r/GuitarAmps, a redditor (that's how Reddit users are called) asked "how come solid state amps never took off like tube amps did?" We can find some colourful statements in the conversation that ensued. Redditor number 2:
> ...Solid State amps did take off in the 80's and 90's. I was just a kid, but no one I knew had a tube amp. The issue was most of them sounded like shit compared to tube. [...] I'm not a solid state hater either...[...] Jonny Greenwood [from Radiohead] uses a ss Fender, or did for years at least.[...] Anyway I just love and prefer how tube amps respond, sound, feel... obviously it's a difficult thing to replicate and I think the best sounding solid states are the ones that are their own beast and not necessarily trying to replicate the tube sound.[^notASolidStateHater]

Redditor number 3 wrote:
> I think originally, [solid-state] amp makers were trying to make the guitar sound accurate. Guitarists didn't want accurate, they wanted awesome. Cranked tubes add high end because it's easier to push than lower frequencies. They compress because of power sag and response time. They are large and can vibrate so feedback tends to be resonant. It's almost like a part of the instrument now.[^interestingInteractions]

Provoking an interesting reply from redditor number 4:
> [Solid-state amps] demonstrably don't sound as good. Even as the tech developed. [...] Now, solid state will sound as good some day (and high-end modeling stuff might already be there), but historically pretty much every production solid state amp has been inferior to any decent tube amp.
> Edit: come on; you all know what I'm saying. Yes, Roland jazz chorus is a good amp etc. But if you look up lists attempting to rank the best amps ever made, on pretty much every list, 9 of the 10 amps listed are going to be tube amps. And that's for a reason.[^iI3]

Redditor number 5:
> this is simply untrue, "sound better" is subjective and solid state amplification wins in almost every objective measure such as cost, reliability, headroom, amount of gain, transparent amplification + eq control, then start including on board fx (although there's an argument to be made abt analog vs digital fx) and your point is pretty weak
> tube responsiveness is like the only thing that is "better" but even then it is just because guitarists have learned to adjust their dynamics and playing style around tube amps [^iI4]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarAmps/comments/1fhktq2/comment/lndanxc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Redditor 4 again:
> I feel like I'm in bizarro land; every gear post with killer gear features a tube amp, and suddenly everyone is like "solid state amps are great!"[^iI5]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarAmps/comments/1fhktq2/comment/lnf3res/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

These two dialogues lay it out pretty clearly for us: there is the divide between tubes and transistors and we find digital emulators narrowing the gap. However, in some aspects tube and solid-state amps have more in common between one another than with their digital counterparts, suggesting a second division, this time between analog and digital. 

On one extreme, analog amplifiers are interacted with mostly by turning knobs and toggling switches, which give access to defined and limited parameters. It is a very hands-on and direct way of interfacing with the equipment, as the controls can all be reached immediately by the user, its physical nature making them easier to tinker with and modify. Software--the quintessential manifestation of digital--, on the other extreme, leads to a different kind of interaction. Even when software mirrors the interface of an analog amplifier, it still involves the mediation of generic computer input devices. Reaching for and turning a physical knob is fundamentally different from picking up a mouse, moving its cursor across the screen until the (often small) image of a knob, and then clicking and dragging to adjust the virtual control. Touchscreens are not much better: though more direct in the reaching aspect, they often require waking up the device first and then demand more of the user's attention throughout the interaction due to the complete lack of tactile feedback.

***

Now that we built some common ground about the tension between tube, solid-state and software amplifiers, we can get to some of the arguments I have been able to gather during approximately one year of fieldwork on the aforementioned online spaces.[REFERENCIA] The conversations and discussions I followed throughout this period started and revolved around the various aspects of guitar amplification that I presented above, but bigger patterns began to take shape, revealing some of the bases and fundamentals of people's reasoning and arguments. These will be briefly developed below based on what I saw people argue.

### 1. Access

Technology has been hailed as a democratizing force in itself at least since the beginning of the so-called internet age,[^internetAndTech] and today more than ever there's practically no technological affair that isn't connected to the internet (in both senses). Covering a broad spectrum that touches on digital rights activism, the free culture movement, Wikipedia, "copyfight", free and open-source software, crowdfunding, self-publishing initiatives, cryptocurrencies, podcasting, "value-for-value" initiatives, grassroots journalism, the so-called Arab Spring and even YouTube, technology is the common enabler to all of these phenomena. Phenomena that, by its turn, can be regarded as democratizing in one sense or another. More directly related to music, streaming and piracy made entire song catalogs immediately available to anyone with an internet-connected device; blogs and, later, social media made it possible for musicians to cut costs on publicity; and tech-deflation[^techDeflation] (the downward pressure on prices as new tech gets old), put formerly inaccessible "studio-grade" gear in the bedrooms of hobbyists. Music software is especially characteristic of the phenomenon: sounds such as those of a symphony orchestra, ambience like that of a reverb chamber or the tone and affordances of an all-analog Neve console are currently accessible to virtually anyone in the form of a software plugin, whereas they were previously attainable only to artists signed to a big recording label with a correspondingly big budget. 

Democracy and its advances and reverses throughout History form a complex theme that obviously cannot be satisfactorily dealt within the constraints of this article,[^deibert].

["In principle, an increase in the circulation and the variety of ideas and artistic works would eventually feed back into more general democratizing processes such as demands for rights and representation or struggles against oppression.[^darnton]

However, the forces that matter to our discussion here are those that enable people to acquire knowledge and broadcast what they make with that knowledge. More specifically, we are looking at some of the possibilities for people to get their artistic aspirations in motion and eventually released. This is also the reason I am treating software as a metonymy for technology. In a sense, software is where it all "happens" with regard to the digital amplifiers at the center of our discussion. Though it may sound like I am simply singing the praises of music software, looking at the possibilities and affordances that these solutions offer makes clearer what is at stake when we start to see people put so much stress on their shortcomings. As we will see below, sometimes a person celebrates a certain feature only to immediately see that same feature be turned on its head and be considered a problem by an interlocutor.

### 2. Flexibility

Software can either be easier or harder to use depending on the user’s skill, but it offers flexibility hardware rarely achieves—at least within the constraints set by the maker. Unlike hardware, software isn’t limited by physical properties like space or power. For instance, tube amps are known to deliver their best sound only within a certain volume range, meaning you need to deal with loud levels to get the tone you want. Software, however, allows for more control: you can achieve the same tone at any volume by adjusting later gain stages, or switch speakers with just a few clicks—or, at worst, by downloading and installing an impulse response (IR). In contrast, changing a speaker in a physical amp involves buying, installing, and soldering, which requires expertise and can be dangerous.

However, digital flexibility comes with constraints. Users are often at the mercy of the product maker’s design. While you can swap out components in analog amps or tweak internal settings, digital models and software are limited to what the developer allows. Even though IRs can be used across platforms, the marketplace for presets and captures creates an ecosystem lock-in, with users tied to a specific product’s offerings. Rhett Shull has pointed out that one reason for the Kemper amp’s success was its ability to allow users to capture their own amps, creating a massive library of user-generated profiles.

This is where NAM (Neural Amp Modeler) stands out. As Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), NAM breaks from proprietary ecosystems, offering users the ability to create, modify, and share their own amp models without being tied to a specific product. While more complex than adjusting a physical amp, NAM eliminates the risks of damaging real hardware, and being open-source means the software can evolve thanks to community contributions.

Furthermore, the flexibility of digital solutions allows users to combine and manipulate multiple software tools in ways hardware simply can’t match. For example, creating a sound that would require three separate VOX AC30 amps, each mic’ed and set up in a controlled environment, is trivial with software. In the analog world, this would involve substantial cost, space, and logistics—something impractical for most users.

While digital flexibility is remarkable, it's worth noting that hardware allows for a level of hands-on intervention that software doesn’t easily provide. With hardware, users can modify or even repair their gear, a flexibility that is rare in the digital world. Modding forums are filled with examples of guitarists tweaking their equipment, but it’s uncommon to hear about users suggesting they modify a plugin’s code. This reflects the fact that digital gear often requires access to source code and technical expertise to modify, limiting hands-on adjustments to a specialized few.

The flexibility of digital software can create a “lock-in” effect. Users rely heavily on presets, IRs, and models created within a specific ecosystem. For example, people often buy or share presets because they don’t want to spend the time tinkering with settings themselves, relying instead on others’ expertise. This shift towards preset-based usage can be seen as both a convenience and a constraint, limiting the deeper engagement many users might have with their software or gear.

It might seem like I’m only praising software, but just five minutes with it and you'll see there's a steep learning curve, and not all analog knowledge easily translates to the digital world. The abundance of tutorials and the market for presets are proof of this. Selling presets has even become a business.

### 3. Interface

A significant portion of music software is designed to replicate coveted hardware, sometimes building on it, but often aiming to mimic it as closely as possible, including its user interface (UI). Compared to physical gear, software is usually cheaper, and sometimes even free (if piracy is considered), which makes it accessible to those who can't afford traditional studio setups. Studio time is expensive, not just because of the gear but also due to the logistical and social challenges of working in a studio. Traveling, scheduling time slots, and interacting with studio professionals all add to the cost.

This accessibility creates a divide between analog and digital realms. Some argue that the two are incommensurable because the skills learned in one don’t easily translate to the other. However, software’s attempt to faithfully emulate analog gear often leads to expectations that the skills and knowledge gained from using one will transfer to the other. For instance, the Neural DSP digital version of the all-analog Tone King Imperial MKII aims to replicate both the look and the feel of the original amp, but digital interfaces still struggle with the inherent limitations of the medium.

![Hardware Tone King Imperial MKII - front](./assets/TKImk2-front.jpg)
![Hardware Tone King Imperial MKII - back](./assets/TKImk2-back.jpg)
![NeuralDSP Tone King Imperial MKII plugin - front](./assets/NDSP-TKIml2-front.png)
![NeuralDSP Tone King Imperial MKII plugin - back](./assets/NDSP-TKIml2-back.png)

A common complaint with digital interfaces is the reliance on menus or virtual controls, which disrupt the direct, tactile interaction common in the analog world. This is especially problematic in live performance settings, where users are often forced to navigate small touchscreens or use indirect input methods. Many prefer the immediacy and tactile feedback of hardware, where adjusting a knob is simple and direct. The “menu navigation” model, while functional, is often cited as a major barrier for those who value the hands-on control of hardware.

The divide between analog and digital isn’t just about sound; it’s about interaction. Hardware provides immediacy and tactile control, while digital systems offer greater flexibility and versatility, often at a lower cost. However, the interface plays a pivotal role in how users experience these systems. It dictates how easily users can emulate the tactile experience of using real hardware, and often, it’s the interface that makes the digital experience feel disconnected from the analog one. There is always the "tone problem", though.

### 4. Tone

Comparisons between digital versions and "the real deal" abound on the internet. Here's what turns up in a simple YouTube search (on 2023-11-14) using the query "Neural DSP Tone King Imperial MKII vs real amp":

![thumbnail 5](./assets/NDSPvsAmp-5.png)

![thumbnail 3](./assets/NDSPvsAmp-3.png)
![thumbnail 2](./assets/NDSPvsAmp-2.png)
![thumbnail 1](./assets/NDSPvsAmp-1.png)

The most common argument voiced against the proponents of digital emulators is some variation of "nothing does what a tube does (and nothing ever will)". This is usually countered by accusations of elitism, conservatism and of being stuck in the past, with the "Ok boomer" meme often being brought up. Nonetheless, those who defend tubes usually affirm that anyone who thinks that amp-modelling technology has matured and is now practically indistinguishable from the real thing have never experienced a tube doing its thing. This is actually a significant point, as we saw when discussing access to technology earlier. Age can play an important role here, as older people who have been playing guitar for long have probably been more exposed in one way or another to tube amps due to their pervasiveness in the past. Also, younger people are less likely to have amassed the financial resources to acquire more expensive equipment. I believe it is fair to ask if the "nothing but tubes" angle is not a form of gatekeeping. As the author of an article in amplifier maker Laney's blog wrote, "most players tend to graduate to tube amps from solid-state amplifiers, they (tube amps) can be known as more aspirational amplifiers – something that you 'graduate' to" (https://www.laney.co.uk/blog/solid-state-vs-tube-amps-why-be-forced-to-choose/#:~:text=Solid%2Dstate%20amps%20don%27t,way%20as%20a%20tube%20amp, Oct 4 2023).

Still, of course there is plenty of young people who have played tube amplifiers and there is also a significant amount of older people who only started playing guitar at a later stage in life and likely have not experienced vintage equipment. By far, the most common "middle ground" argument I have seen is that according to which the difference between a tube amplifier and its digital counterpart is so small at this point that nobody in the audience notices or cares. One common counter-argument may be summarized in the idea of "death by a thousand cuts", suggesting that the amp's tone may not matter in the minute differences experienced at this point, but when people cut corners multiple times along the signal chain, no matter how small the compromises are, they add up quickly.

Significantly more interesting, though, is that, as more people began conceding that digital has probably caught up with tubes in terms of sound, a new argument surfaced. As if dealing with a moving target, many guitarists started saying that, even though modern digital solutions *sound* like real tube amplifiers, they *feel* different under the fingers. I have yet to see someone say it feels different and it's better this way, but sometimes a more courageous user says something along the lines of "I've never even experienced the real thing... so what it doesn't feel the same?"

Yet more elusive than tone, feel is not only difficult to quantify, but it is also almost impossible to communicate, especially when mediated by the internet, where one has to rely on words, sound clips and video. Youtuber Rhett Shull took it to an extreme:

> It may just be a placebo. *It totally could just be in my head, but I don't really care.* That's what matters. If I like the way that I sound and I feel good when I'm playing, I'm going to sound better. (Rhett Shull https://youtu.be/873F0dHl_ME?si=8WBOmsAAxnuiSFW4&t=1263 21:03, my emphasis)

As we can see, Shull is not even looking for proof anymore. It does not matter to him if it is all in his head. What matters is how he feels, which is also what another user is looking for in the following question, posted in the Line 6 Helix Family User Group: (https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BAA5caQJU/?)

> I'm sorry guys, but man I miss having a tube amp and a cab that I could tweak and get the air moving. I used to have a 4x12 cab and a tube head. Now I have a Line6 Helix and a Headrush 112 [The Headrush 112 is a powered cabinet with one 12 inch speaker made to provide as neutral response as possible to the modeler so that the amplifier, effects and speaker emulation that takes place in the software can be reproduced as faithfully as possible] and I can say, not the same thing. Is it the Headrush?? There are some awesome amps in the Helix but how can I get the same feel as with a proper 4x12 cab? I frigging miss that feeling.

To this, a user replied saying that "the Headrush needs to be cranked up to sound good" and some others suggested playing loud through the PA, arguments that defy one the main points of using a modeller, that is, being able to get the tone of a cranked tube amp at any volume. Two other users went with variations on practicality and flexibility, respectively, defending the modeler: "I lugged amps around for decades. A Helix direct offers so much more flexibility. I would never go back, to to each their own" and "been using helix since 2016. By 2018 I sold off my amp collection. Recently got tube amp g.a.s. [gear acquisition syndrome] bad and bought a really nice used amp. Owned it a week....could not deal with the lack of versatility!" Finally, a user tried to be comprehensive, got praise from other forum dwellers and gave us everything we could want in our investigation:

> (...) It's a completely different ballgame. Helix is an amazing piece of gear - but you have to think like a sound engineer vs a guitar player who cranks amps. (...) the truth is - it's just not going to be an amp in the room. The closest I can get to that is running into my PC212+ with speaker sims and playing loud. It does the trick for me but will never be my old power amp and 4x12 set up. If that's what you want, stick with that. If you want to migrate to the digital world you'll have to learn how it all works and embrace it as a lightweight, digital replacement that is an amp "in the next room, mic'd up for studio recording and coming out of the monitors in the control room" with your current setup if that makes sense. I've had my struggles, but do not miss lugging all that gear around and changing fuses in the middle of songs when there was dirty power, the list goes on.

We see practicality, we see reliability, we see the physicality and the idea of different paradigms, the relationship between those two worlds... We also see one of the pilars on top of which the modelling world rests: the sounds we have been hearing on records since the 1950s. 

I'D LIKE TO END HERE AND ASK WHY PEOPLE ARE MORE OPEN TO DIGITAL THAN TO SS
PERHAPS DIGITAL IS A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAK *AND* AN AESTHETIC BRIDGE
ALSO BECAUSE MANY OTHER STUFF IN OUR CULTURE PUTS SO MUCH TRUST EVEN IN DIGITAL
há as affordances próprias do digital: Prog metal tem características que se favorecem de modelling, however, it's interesting to observe that modelling, which is the most modern, exists precisely because people want the old stuff without the problems of the old stuff: reliability, weight, price

and some people want exactly the old stuff, with all its shortcomings
there's an understanding of it carrying its affordances in the whole package perhaps
but then new problems arise: does it really sound like the old stuff? the interface is a problem. You can't fix digital stuff etc.
As I said earlier about the Roland jazz chorus,
it was its own thing
it was modern and hip until it wasn't anymore, just like the DX7, the Linn drum machine or chorus pedals… 
- …all of which have made or are making a comeback

digital is perfect for the home studio, for working in-the-box. In-the-box is the way to go in a world in which very few make a living as musicians

Of course, the home studio has its limitations too. Acoustics can be a big issue in achieving "radio-ready" results, though room treatment is possible and has also gone down in pricing. Space is also a problem both to fit equipment in a bedroom and because one must avoid making too much noise, especially in urban areas. There are also workarounds, such as wearing headphones or keeping volumes down for mixing or resorting to software that tries to tailor the sound output to the room by employing compensation algorithms and this is where working in-the-box really shines. Still, the feasibility of an apartment-dweller successfully recording drums in their bedroom is severely limited. This is where sample libraries come in, offering drum sounds and patterns recorded by professional studio musicians at high end studios that, in the final mix, will arguably sound better than drum sounds captured in a mid-tier studio at a fraction of the cost and time it would take.

mesmo para os pros: Falar de silent stages, in-ears e da pressão por stage volume mais baixo (entra a questão da conveniência do digital)

But in the end what becomes clear here is how things are interconnected, making the whole picture of tech as enabler more complex: people want to record music and they can do it at home now, but the coveted equipment isn't suitable to home use. A studio would be needed, really, due to volume, acoustics and space needs. But then this would require time and financial resources. Studios are less expensive because tech-deflation also put more previously-high end gear within the reach of small/medium studios, but still one needs to block time to go to the studio. Contemporary life, has made it difficult for musicians to live off their music and most of them have day jobs, which makes blocking time much harder and making music late at night in a bedroom is often the only possibility, so the home studio is the way to go in a world in which musicians aren't signed to a big label to do a record and then have their time resources all employed due to that being their job. All things considered, when compared to "the model", tech-enabled home music-making bears the amateur mark from its birth. Due to the conditions in contemporary capitalism, it's not made by people whose efforts can be all concentrated on making it; it's not created in the same spaces as that one was and was created employing simulations of that equipment. Even if one has the same amplifier and mic'ed it with the same coveted vintage microphones of yore, was it recorded in Studio Two of Abbey Road studios (https://www.abbeyroad.com/studio-two), with its "warm acoustics"?...

Interesting to think of how people engage so much with this. Não é real. Vc vê Youtuber Rick Beato putting his dream rig through its paces and in the room it was probably incredible, but for those who watch from Youtube is sounds like any other good guitar sound, just like thousands of videos made using modellers.
