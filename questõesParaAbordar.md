Para a discussão sobre o NAM

Software é flexível [fazer referência ao ponto {1} no texto]
- mas as pessoas normalmente não têm como mexer nele
    - em amplificadores (analógicos) elas mexem
- no digital (software (se não for foss) e amp), vc está at the mercy of the maker
    - claro que IRs podem ser usados em qq coisa, mas o mercado de presets e a comunidade criam lock-in no ecossistema de cada um
        - tem alguma fala de youtuber (talvez Rhett Shull) de que algum de que o Kemper, por permitir que as pessoas capturassem seus próprios amps, fez o produto bombar (agora vai achar isso, talvez tenha sido no Dipped in Tone)
        - o NAM oferece tudo isso e ainda é gratuito
- NAM é exceção porque é FOSS - embora seja muito mais difícil que mexer num amp, mas ao mesmo tempo vc não corre risco de vida
- NAM quebra com tudo isso




CONCLUSÃO


[forumCulture]
O artigo é “gear talk on the internet: the case of guitar amplifiers”? O vídeo do Beato “playing my dream rig” é uma base boa pra discussão do artigo 
- como as pessoas se engajam tanto nisso. Não é real. Vc vê o Beato botando a dream rig dele e na sala devia ser uma cosia incrível, mas pra quem assiste no YouTube é só um bom som de guitarra, como o de milhões de vídeos feitos com modellers. 
- If you wanna move people you got to move air: mas isso é pro ao vivo (e mesmo assim, o PA move ar
- A quantidade de reviews de gear que dizem pro pessoal usar headphones já mostra como as mediações estão lá e ngm tá prestando atenção a elas
- E a internet produz um efeito de verdade 
The current debate on digital modelling and capturing of guitar amplifiers, touching on themes like equipment choice, access to culture, music-making, and, coming full-circle, the role that technology currently plays.
[internet forums] These spaces mark an interesting shift away from classic delimitations based on musical genres and how they map onto identity. Musicians have discussed their instruments and related equipment probably since these tools first came into being, but "forum culture"[^forumCulture] carries the peculiarity of putting practitioners of very different musical genres in contact. This shifts the focus of the conversation to the instruments and tools themselves, whereas when a musician meets another in a gig or in a music store the kind of music each one plays tends to be present one way or another. Suppose someone goes to a bass players forum like TalkBass to ask about a good DI box. Usually they'll ask about the other users' experience with DI boxes, explaining in what kind of venue (size, volume levels and signal path) they are looking into employing that piece of equipment. Of course musicians mention the kind of music they will be playing, but, at least in English-speaking forums, there seems to be a curious tendency to overlook genre preferences.[^EnglishSpeakingOverlooksGenre] Sometimes other users will ask for more detail regarding genre too, but more often than not people will jump in with their suggestions and those can look quite objective while hiding several aesthetic assumptions.
[COLOCAR UM EXEMPLO TRANSCRITO DE FORUM ONDE TENHA UM PRESSUPOSTO DO QUE SERVE PARA UM GÊNERO, MAS NÃO PARA OUTROS – LEMBRO DE UMA CONVERSA QUE LI SOBRE PRINCETON E SE TEM POTÊNCIA PARA FAZER FRENTE A UM BATERISTA E ISSO DEPENDE SE É UM BATERA DE ROCK OU DE JAZZ]
- forum culture creates a level playing field that produces interesting effects
    - the whole mythbusting (JHS faz muito) but also gear shootout videos became a thing
    - People agonizing over the small mid scoop of this or that amplifier and then go play in a bar - if at all playing somewhere
As the example above shows, (musical) identity is constantly produced, reiterated but also subtly and continuously updated with with new layers and bifurcations as the discussion unfolds. Evidently, one's choices with regard to equipment–and also music, clothing, preferred restaurant in town, car, friends, anything really–are informed by that person's position in the social spectrum, but to look at those choices as being a catalyst instead of a result can offer something interesting and internet forums are a privileged instance to do so.
This goes along the lines of many current sociological accounts on social media [DESENVOLVER]

[vintage]
- from the early 2000s, what you will see is mostly “classic” rock tones (the guitar is a rock instrument, so that’s where I’ll focus)
            - preference for tubes, vintage sounds, Fender guitars and basses become hip again
                - I mention basses here because, interestingly, in the studio they never came out of fashion, but at this point people started showing up with them again (and 90s punk played an important under-appreciated role here, because this has always been part of the punk aesthetic) on stages and promo material
            - foto banda de rock 80, 90 e 2000
            - there’s a shift from metal to more “earthy” genres and the instruments go together; it’s important to notice and it’s hard to state this without going into numbers, which I can’t do now, but let’s just agree that’s when Mumford and Sons, Edward Sharpe became a thing, while in the 90s what did we have? The Black Crowes and some Lenny Kravitz and Pearl Jam (mas esses são early 90s)—Counting Crows and Wallflowers if you really want to sweat it, but look at how the guitar sound is still so Hi-Fi (One Headlight (1996), though the clothes are already spot on!) compared to Steady as She Goes (2006).
            - For a while electric guitars even took the backseat and acoustics, ukes and banjos were at the forefront (tocar a intro de Elephant gun):
                - foto Beirut, Mumford
                - até um site como Reverb.com aparecer pode ser um indício, embora tenha muito mais coisa em jogo aí (internet, tech, startup culture)
                - Final proof: in 2012 American STD starts coming with Custom Shop 60s pups

- I think I’ve made my case
    - All this creates a situation in which vintage pieces of gear are “aspirational”, something that you 'graduate' to" (https://www.laney.co.uk/blog/solid-state-vs-tube-amps-why-be-forced-to-choose/#:~:text=Solid%2Dstate%20amps%20don%27t,way%20as%20a%20tube%20amp, Oct 4 2023)
    - And forum culture (referencia) creates a situation of production of consensus:
        - exemplo do TB sobre o Ellefson (tenho um screenshot disso)
- So we already had tubes;
    - SS came along and was modern for a while
    - Then it became dated and everyone was into vintage
    - In fact vintage never went totally away, but it was a bit of a trick of the trade (pics of artists using guitars they wouldn’t use in the studio) and then it became mainstream 
    - And a huge market was born
    - And forum culture exposes very clearly how people from the most varied backgrounds and levels of experience are there speaking in a somewhat level playing field and nobody really knows who is who and who knows what they’re talking about

FOR THIS PRESENTATION, I’D LIKE TO END HERE AND ASK WHY PEOPLE ARE MORE OPEN TO DIGITAL THAN TO SS
PERHAPS DIGITAL IS A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAK *AND* AN AESTHETIC BRIDGE
ALSO BECAUSE MANY OTHER STUFF IN OUR CULTURE PUTS SO MUCH TRUST EVEN IN DIGITAL
It’s interesting to observe that modelling, which is the most modern, exists precisely because people want the old stuff without the problems of the old stuff: reliability, weight, price
and some people want exactly the old stuff, with all its shortcomings
there’s an understanding of it carrying its affordances in the whole package perhaps
but then new problems arise: does it really sound like the old stuff? the interface is a problem. You can’t fix digital stuff etc.
As I said earlier about the Roland jazz chorus,
it was its own thing
it was modern and hip until it wasn’t anymore, just like the DX7, the Linn drum machine or chorus pedals… 
- …all of which have made or are making a comeback
